A javascript clock based on Wes Bos' Javascript30 course. I changed the styling a bit and made it a "grandfather clock" that plays the noisy clocks from Pink Floyd's "Time" on the hour part of the "Time" solo on the half-hour, and the beginning of the vocal solo from "The Great Gig in the Sky" on the quarter-hour. A different animated quote fades in and out as the audio samples play. I will continue to add features as I progress with javascript.
