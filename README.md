A javascript clock based on Wes Bos' Javascript30 course. I changed the styling a bit and made it a "grandfather clock" that plays the noisy clocks from Pink Floyd's "Time" on the hour, part of the "Time" solo on the half-hour,the beginning of the vocal solo from "The Great Gig in the Sky" on the quarter-hour, and the "heartbeats" every 10 minutes." A different animated quote fades in and out as the audio samples play. Next addition will be a button to toggle audio on or off.
